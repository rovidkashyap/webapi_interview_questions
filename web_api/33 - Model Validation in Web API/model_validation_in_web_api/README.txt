Here for Model Validation in Web API, It is a way to ensure that incoming data meets certain criteria
before it is processed. This can be achieved using data annotations on your model classes and checking
the model state in your controller actions.

Here in this Project we are going to use the same project as we used in earlier application our
List of Books Projects and apply certain validation rules and check modle validation on it.

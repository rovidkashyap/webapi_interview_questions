In ASP.NET Core, MVC (Model-View-Controller) and Web API are two frameworks used for building web 
applications, but they are designed to handle different types of requests and responses. Here are the 
primary differences between ASP.NET Core MVC and Web API in terms of state management and other aspects:

ASP.NET Core MVC

 ------------------------------------ STATE MANAGEMENT -----------------------------------------------

Session State: MVC applications often use session state to store user data across multiple requests 
				within a web session. Session state can be used to store data such as user preferences, 
				login status, and other temporary information.

View State: In traditional ASP.NET Web Forms (not Core), view state is used to preserve page and control 
			values between round trips. However, ASP.NET Core MVC does not use view state.

------------------------------------------ PURPOSE ---------------------------------------------------

ASP.NET Core MVC is primarily used to create web applications that serve HTML pages. It follows the 
Model-View-Controller pattern, where the controller handles the user input, manipulates the model, 
and updates the view to reflect changes.

-------------------------------------- RESPONSE TYPE --------------------------------------------------

MVC controllers typically return views (HTML pages). They can also return other types of responses like 
JSON, but the primary focus is on rendering HTML.

------------------------------------------- ROUTING ---------------------------------------------------

MVC uses attribute-based routing or convention-based routing to map URLs to actions in controllers.
User Interface:

MVC is tightly coupled with views and uses Razor syntax to generate dynamic HTML. It is designed to build interactive web applications with a strong emphasis on user interfaces.
ASP.NET Core Web API

---------------------------------------- STATE MANAGEMENT ---------------------------------------------

Stateless Nature: Web APIs are designed to be stateless, meaning each request from the client to the 
			server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. Web 
			APIs do not use session state or view state.

Token-Based Authentication: For maintaining user state, Web APIs often use token-based authentication 
							mechanisms like JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

--------------------------------------------- PURPOSE -------------------------------------------------

ASP.NET Core Web API is designed for creating HTTP services that can be consumed by various clients, 
Including browsers, mobile devices, and other servers. It is ideal for building RESTful services.

-------------------------------------------- RESPONSE TYPE --------------------------------------------

Web API controllers return data, typically in JSON or XML format. The focus is on providing data 
services, not on rendering HTML views.

----------------------------------------------- ROUTING -----------------------------------------------

Web API uses attribute-based routing, similar to MVC, but is often used to map HTTP verbs (GET, POST, 
PUT, DELETE) to controller actions.

------------------------------------------- USER INTERFACE --------------------------------------------

Web API does not deal with views or user interfaces. It focuses purely on handling HTTP requests and 
returning appropriate responses, making it suitable for creating backend services and APIs.

============================================= KEY DIFFERENCES =========================================

-------------------------------------------- STATE MAMANGEMENT ----------------------------------------

MVC: Can use session state for storing user-specific data across requests.
Web API: Stateless by design, each request is independent and self-contained.

-------------------------------------------- PURPOSE AND USAGE ----------------------------------------

MVC: Primarily used to serve dynamic web pages and create web applications with rich user interfaces.
Web API: Used to create RESTful services and provide data endpoints for clients.

--------------------------------------------- RESPONSE TYPE -------------------------------------------

MVC: Typically returns views (HTML).
Web API: Returns data (JSON/XML).

---------------------------------------------- ROUTING ------------------------------------------------

MVC: Maps URLs to controller actions and often deals with rendering views.
Web API: Maps HTTP verbs to actions and deals with data processing.

----------------------------------------------- SUMMARY -----------------------------------------------

ASP.NET Core MVC is suitable for building web applications where the focus is on delivering HTML 
content and managing user sessions.

ASP.NET Core Web API is ideal for building RESTful services that provide data to various clients 
in a stateless manner.
